# Gemini RPG Adventure

This prototype is an exercise in agentic orchestration. The Large Language Model (Gemini 3 Pro) is your dungeon master, and it works together with a lore keeper agent, a rules agent, a story pacing agent, a dice rolling agent, a visualizer agent, and an optional Storyteller Agent to give you a short Dungeons & Dragons adventure with a beginning, middle, and end.
